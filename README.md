# WeatherApp-2.0

This is Weather App v2.0, a creation in which I remade it with React (With a bit of ChatGPT's guidance)

=====================================================================================================================================

Some key things to note:

- Background image still needs work and maybe a new one with much higher resolution
- Features such as little photos that show the weather conditions will be added in future patches
- A map that display the location being search to see the weather

** FEATURES **

- A simple UI that lets user do a search on a location's weather of their choosing 
- Their searches are then saved to a local database which can be access by using MongoDB
